This Guide is for quick apply Oracle best practice step by step base on Michael Webster’s best practice. 
In filed , I found most of people read the best practice guide but still can’t apply those parameter or settings.
So I wrote this guide for who do not have any Oracle technical background .
It’s a quick way to apply those best practice. I still suggest you must read our Nutanix best guide to understand why we tune this.
You can use this on your POC or when customer want put Oracle on Nutanix.
In this guide , we do not mentioned about how to install a Oracle database.
If you want learn how to installed a Oracle database , you can find ”how to” in these links.
